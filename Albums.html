<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Albums and Music</b></h1>


<div class="with-margin">
<p style="text-align: center;"> In this paragraph you will learn about the music - and albums SMOKE A.L.A.R.M. hope you enjoy!!!          -            the beauty of SMOKE A.L.A.R.M.'s music is that he doesn't plan them. He just plays with the music he has! Even though he owns a DJX1, he doesn't use it as much as his brother, ALOHA:XERO, uses it. he's in a dou band with his brother, who he is also inspired by.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> He also owns an electric guitar but unusually, he doesn't use it. He almost always sits in his brother's bedroom to make his songs, and sometimes wears Linkin Park merch too. 'I'm ready to spread the DJ world!' -Nicolas LAHR (the DJ)</p>

<p style="text-align: centre;"> <b> Here is the album Let Them Flow and a small description of the pieces of music.</b></p>

 <p style="text-align: center; color: #0062ff;"> <b>Once More </b></p>
<p> The inspiration for this song came from lots of people who also used Bandlab. He created it in BandLab and used many loopers and beats that he thought were successful because just like any other soundtrack, it never came out the same as expected.  </p>
 <p style="text-align: center; color: #ff0067;"> <b>Never in my Life </b></p>
<p style="text-align: centre;"> Never in my Life was obviously the best of all because I used a completely different way to start the music. Here's how it went:beat-beat-beat-music-music-music-music-beat-music-end. It could never be better!</p>


<p style="text-align: center; color: #698252;"> <b>NEAR AND FAR </b></p>
<p>Near and Far was named by my brother, it is Smoke's latest piece of music and the second best by popular opinion. It's an electic piece that has been created using more of everything! </p>
