    <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Story About SMOKE A.L.A.R.M. (first person)</h1>

<div class="with-margin">
<p style="text-align: center;"> Ever since I started on Bandlab, I’ve been inspired by lots of people and within 3 days, I had already created an album! Have a look at albums in this website. I enjoy playing with electronic looper packs in Bandlab and collaborating with my brother, ALOHA:XERO. Here is the timeline of my DJ names.

1-The World
2-Lincoln park(I think you can guess why)
3-SMOKE A.L.A.R.M.
Have a look on Bandlab at my album:Let Them Flow. Enjoy the beats of 0nce More, Never !n my l!fe and NEAR AND FAR.
The first ever song I made was a remix of ALOHA:XERO’s first piece of music. Both remix and normal version still not published.
Thank you for inspiring me:
Camellia
Boom kitty
Pendulum
Teminite
That’s it for my story. Like and follow me on Bandlab!
